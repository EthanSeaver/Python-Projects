[HG 962e528796ab] May 26, 2013
    Add full Python new buffer protocol support to Pygame 1.9.2. In addition
    Python level array interface support is added to several Pygame objects
    and function. This changeset marks the end of a series of commits,
    starting with revision 98e3a61592c1 on September 8, 2012.

    Affected Pygame buffer exporting objects are BufferProxy, Surface
    (through method get_buffer), Sound, PixelArray, and Color. Affected
    importers are Sound, freetype.Font, BufferProxy, and the
    pixelcopy module functions (array_to_surface, surface_to_array, map_array,
    and make_surface).

    Internally, Pygame has been rewritten to use the C Py_buffer to represent
    external array objects. For Python 2.5 and earlier, which do not support
    the new buffer protocol, Py_buffer is defined in pygame.h. The details
    of translating between Py_buffer and the array interface are now found
    in only on C file, base.c. Consequently, the base module exports several new
    Pygame C api functions and a new exception: PgBuffer_AsArrayInterface,
    PgBuffer_AsArrayStruct, PgObject_GetBuffer, PgBuffer_Release,
    PgDict_AsBuffer, and PgExc_BufferError. These api additions also reduce
    the amount of conditional compilation code required to support Python
    versions which lack the new buffer protocol.

    Finally, for proper testing, additions are made to the unit test framework.
    A new extension module, pygame.newbuffer, adds new classes for importing
    and exporting the new buffer interface at the Python level. It is built
    conditionally. The new pygame.tests.test_utils.buftools Python module
    implements the high level classes used in the actual unit tests. Also,
    a new class in pygame.tests.test_utils.arrinter exports a C level
    array interface from the Python level.
    
[SVN 3062] Mar 30, 2011
    Port scrap module to Python 3.x (merge with branches/port_scrap_py3).
    Accidently committed in rev 3061.

[SVN 3057-3061]
    Update Pygame Event type to have mutable attributes as per feature request
    62 on Motherhamster's Bugzilla 

[SVN 3006] Feb 24, 2011
    [BUG] Fix hanging pointer problem in color.c.
    Add deprecation warning for Numeric in surfarray and sndarray.

[SVN 3003-3005] Feb 21-24, 2011
    Enhance array support in pixelcopy methods. map_array now accepts
    a three byte integer for target array. Surface.get_view now
    allows a 2D view for 24 bitsized arrays, even though not accepted
    by numpy. Color objects now export an array struct interface.
    Various bug fixes for Python 3.1.

[SVN 3000-3002] Feb 20, 2011
    Merge the surface_buffer branch back into trunk.
    1) Rename module _arraysurfarray to pixelcopy, which implements
       array_to_surface (blit_surface), surface_to_array, and map_array.
    2) Reimplement _numpysurfarray methods array2d, array3d, array_alpha,
       array_colorkey, and map_surface to use new pixelcopy methods.

    Module pixelcopy reimplements _numericsurfarray using generic
    copy methods that accept objects exporting an array struct interface.
    Along with Surface views, it moves almost all of the _numpysurfarray.py
    functionality into C code. pixelcopy is also independent of NumPy,
    so can work with other array like objects.

[SVN 2983-2987] Feb 08, 2011
    Merge the buffer branch back into trunk.
    1) Extend pygame.mixer.Sound() to load samples from an object with
       an array struct interface or the new buffer protocol. Exports
       an array struct interface.
    2) Update sndarray to use the new Sound features on numpy arrays,
       removing the Python array manipulation code.
    3) Add a new Type, pygame._view.View as a proxy for exporting an
       array struct interface.
    4) Add the pygame.Surface.get_view() method, which returns a View instance.
       Besides creating views describing pixel2d, pixels3d, and pixels_alpha
       arrays, new pixels_red, pixels_green, and pixels_blue views have been
       added.
    5) Update the pixels surfarray methods to use Surface.get_view() for
       numpy arrays, removing the Python array manipulation code. Add new
       methods returning red, green, and blue pixels arrays.

    Fixed color.c for Symbian  Updated Symbian build instructions  Updated
      makeref.py with '--no-code-docs' feature to set empty module docstrings.
    Add <module>_tags.py modules to pygame.tests. This is an alternative
      module level __tags__ globals in the unit test <module>_test.py files
      themselves. The __tags__ global is placed in the corresponding
      <module>_tags.py file instead. This means test modules can be skipped
      by the pygame.tests.go test framework without actually loading the
      test module and running possibly problematic code. It also means
      the test framework can report on which test modules were skipped
      and why.

    [BUG] Stopped releasing GIL on png, and jpeg saving functions because
        they do not seem to be thread safe.

    [BUG] A work around for 8 bit samples being stereo reversed with SDL_mixer.
        Also check the return value of Mix_SetPanning, and raise an 
        error on volume errors.

    [BUG] Changed default chunk size for pygame.mixer to 1024*3.  Which is 
        the magic number which stops scratchy sounds on most systems.  
        However it does make sounds a bit laggier... it's best provided as 
        a config item for users.

    Updated pygame.display.update() to release the GIL whilst doing things,
        so other threads can do things whilst it's updating the screen.

    Some comments to help Mac OSX people installing, and compiling pygame.
        About bdist_mpkg in setup, and also fixed an exception message 
        to be nicer about requiring pyobjc.

Mar 3, 2008
    [BUG] Fixed up pygame.mask.from_surface, got color key, and perpixel alpha 
        modes reversed.

    Also added better test to the mask test.  
        Also it wasn't testing pygame.mask.from_surface at all!

        Started adding test for pygame.sprite.spritecollide.


Feb 19, 2008

    rect for the surface, that contains visible (non-transparent) data.

Feb 14, 2008
    Updated constants GL_SWAP_CONTROL,GL_ACCELERATED_VISUAL,BUTTON_X1,BUTTON_X2

    Added pygame.key.get_repeat to see how holding keys down repeats.  This is
      the sister function of pygame.ket.set_repeat.

    MacOSX, and Windows binaries now use latest SDL 1.2.13

Feb 11, 2008
    An example of using pygame with no windowing system.  Useful for webserver
      scripts, or for little utilities.

    Updated mac_scrap to pass some tests, and raise NotImplementedError 
      otherwise.

    Further Windows build updates:
      For MinGW/MSYS the build process now finds the MSYS and MinGW
      directories automatically. gcc links to msvcr71.dll without
      requiring changes to the gcc specs file. This makes the build
      process GCC Version 4 ready. By default all DLLs are Win32 GUI,
      but can be console. The build progams will run from either the
      Windows or MSYS terminal.

      Fixed a bug where DLLs were not installed in the package directory.
      For Windows, everything now goes into the package directory.

      build_deps.py renamed to msys_build_deps.py to avoid confusion.

Jan 26, 2008
    pygame.sndarray noew can change between Numeric and numpy using the
      new methods pygame.sndarray.use_arraytype () and
      pygame.sndarray.get_arraytypes ().

Jan 24, 2008
    Updated the configuration and build process under Windows. In
       config_msys.py and config.py os.popen is replaced with the newer
       subprocess.Popen so the MSYS will run. Calls to raw_input now
       show the prompt on an MSYS console. In an MSYS build paths
       written to Setup are now Windows paths for distutils. The hard
       coded DLL file paths have been removed from setup.py.  It now
       gets the paths from Setup. Consequently, setup.py is now VC/MinGW
       agnostic.

    Added build_deps.py, an all-in-one dependency builder for
       Windows. Requires MinGW and MSYS.

Jan 8, 2008
    pygame.surfarray now can change between Numeric and numpy using the
       new methods pygame.surfarray.use_arraytype () and
       pygame.surfarray.get_arraytypes ().

Jan 4, 2008
    Removed Numeric compile time dependency.
    Added numpy surface array support.

Dec 31, 2007
    New method pygame.get_sdl_byteorder () to get the SDL byte order.

Dec 15, 2007

    pygame.transform can find edges in an image, get the average surface
      of many surfaces and also threshold an image by color.

Sep 1, 2007
    Added get_buffer() methods to Surface, and Sound - which return a new
     BufferProxy - which is a buffer interface only class.  Thanks Marcus!

Aug 23, 2007

    PixelArray from Marcus.  It's going to be a replacement for surfarray.
    [BUG] Fixed some bugs in Surface with SRCALPHA and input validation.
        Thanks Lenard Lindstrom and Brian Fisher.

Aug 15, 2007
    The sprite module has had some big changes from DR0ID.  It now has a 
     LayeredUpdates, and LayeredDirty groups.  For using layers when
     rendering the sprites.  LayeredDirty is an alternative to 
     RenderUpdates that automatically finds the best display method
     (either full screen updates, or dirty rect updates).  It's faster
     if you have sprites that don't move.  Thanks DR0ID!
    Added pygame.mask.from_surface which can make a Mask object from
     a surface.  It's 128x faster than the python version!
    pygame.movie bug fix. Thanks Lenard Lindstrom!

Jun 25, 2007
    Removed QNX support from scrap module. Thanks Marcus!
    Added smoothscale(with MMX!) function from Richard Goedeken

    Thanks Marcus, and thanks Campbell Barton for spotting them.

May 30, 2007
    Fixed some documentation.  mask, scrap, font modules.
    Fixed the mask.set_at get_at functions to raise a nice exception.
      Thanks piman!
