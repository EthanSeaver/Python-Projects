Pygame 1.9.2 mostly builds with Python 3.x. setup.py installs Pygame 
without any special preparations. However not all modules will be 
included. All SDL only extension modules are available. And some of the 
optional modules are as well.

Use the tests to see which modules are working.

On Windows Pygame uses the same dependencies for Python 3.x as Python 
2.6.
